The provided algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested for loop. This means that it would be inefficient for large input sizes.

Here are some possible improvements to the algorithm:

Sorting: Instead of comparing every pair of elements, we can sort the array in non-decreasing order and then compare adjacent pairs. This reduces the time complexity to O(n log n) due to the sorting step, followed by a linear scan through the sorted array to find the minimum distance.

Divide and conquer: We can use a divide and conquer approach to reduce the time complexity to O(n log n) as well. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, find the minimum distances in each half recursively, and then merge the results. The minimum distance between the two halves is either the minimum of the minimum distances in each half, or the minimum distance between an element in one half and an element in the other half.

Linear time: If we assume that the array is sorted, we can find the minimum distance between adjacent pairs in O(n) time by iterating through the array once and keeping track of the minimum distance seen so far.

Here's an example implementation of the sorting approach in Python:
