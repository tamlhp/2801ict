If the first number (call it "m") is smaller than the second number (call it "n"), the algorithm works as follows:

1. If m = 0, return n and stop; otherwise go to Step 2.
2. Divide n by m and assign the value of the remainder to r
3. Assign the value of m to n and the value of r to m. Go to Step 1.

The largest number of times this can happen during the algorithm's execution on such an input is equal to the number of times the remainder is not zero. Let's denote the first number as m and the second number as n. If we repeatedly apply step 2 of the algorithm, we get:

```
n = m*q + r1
m = r1*q1 + r2
r1 = r2*q2 + r3
...
rn-2 = rn-1*qn-1 + rn
```

where r1, r2, ..., rn are the remainders, q1, q2, ..., qn-1 are the quotients, and rn is the last non-zero remainder.

Since each remainder is smaller than the previous one, the algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps. Moreover, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD of m and n. Therefore, the largest number of times this can happen during the algorithm's execution is n-1, where n is the number of steps required to obtain the GCD.
