1. Yes, the algorithm for sorting an array by counting and then putting each element in its appropriate position using the number of smaller elements is a stable sorting algorithm.

This is because the algorithm sorts the array based on the count of smaller elements, which means that elements with the same value will have the same count of smaller elements. When sorting these elements, the algorithm will preserve their original order, ensuring that they maintain their relative positions in the sorted array. Therefore, the algorithm is stable.

2. No, the counting sort algorithm that sorts an array by counting the number of smaller elements and then uses this information to put each element in its appropriate position is not an in-place sorting algorithm.

This is because the algorithm requires additional memory to store the count of smaller elements and the sorted array. The size of this additional memory depends on the range of values in the input array, which can be significantly larger than the size of the input array itself. Therefore, the algorithm has a space complexity of O(n+k), where n is the size of the input array and k is the range of values in the input array.
